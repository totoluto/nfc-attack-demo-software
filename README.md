# RFID Clone Attack Demo App

This small demo app implements a GUI for interacting with RFID hardware and demonstrating cloning/attack workflows in an educational context. It is written in C using GTK3 and libserialport and is intended for research and teaching purposes only.

Important: This repository contains code that can interact with RFID readers/writers. Use it only on hardware and systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use this code for unauthorized access or illegal activities.

The software for the arduino can be found [here.](https://github.com/totoluto/nfc-attack-demo-arduino)

## Quick summary / contract
- Input: serial device (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0`) and a connected RFID reader/writer
- Output: interactive GTK3 GUI for performing read/clone/demo operations
- Success criteria: binary builds with `make` and the GUI launches and connects to the specified serial port
- Error modes: missing dependencies (pkg-config, GTK3, libserialport), permission errors opening the serial device

## Requirements
- Linux (development tested on Debian/Ubuntu-like systems)
- gcc and standard build tools (make)
- pkg-config
- GTK+ 3 development headers and libraries (packaging: `libgtk-3-dev`)
- libserialport development headers and libraries (packaging: `libserialport-dev`)
- xxd (typically part of the `xxd` or `vim-common` package) — used to embed the Glade file
- dpkg-deb if you want to build the `.deb` package

On Debian/Ubuntu you can install the typical dependencies with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libserialport-dev xxd dpkg-dev
```

## Build
The project uses a Makefile. From the project root run:

```bash
make
```

This will produce the executable at `dist/refid_attack_demo`.

Available make targets:
- `make` or `make all` — build the binary (`dist/refid_attack_demo`)
- `make clean` — remove build artifacts
- `make deb` — builds the binary and packages it as a Debian package (uses the `install/` tree)
- `make uninstall-deb` — remove the installed Debian package (uses `dpkg -r`)

Notes:
- The Makefile embeds `rfid_ui.glade` into `src/rfidUiGlade.c` using `xxd -i`.
- Linking uses `pkg-config` for `gtk+-3.0` and `libserialport` so ensure pkg-config finds those packages.

## Run
After building, run the GUI from the project root:

```bash
./dist/refid_attack_demo
```

If you installed the `.deb` produced by `make deb`, the binary will be copied to `/usr/local/bin/` and you can run `refid_attack_demo` from your PATH.

Serial device permissions
- The app will open a serial port to talk to an RFID reader. Typical devices are `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.
- If you get permission denied when opening the serial device, either run the app as a user in the appropriate group (e.g., `dialout` on many Linux systems) or run with elevated privileges for testing only.

Example: add your user to `dialout` (logout required):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

## Usage
- Launch the app and select the serial device.
- Use the on-screen controls to read tags, view tag data, and (for demonstration) clone or write tag data to compatible hardware.
- The UI is defined in `rfid_ui.glade` and embedded in the binary at build time.

```

## Troubleshooting
- Missing `pkg-config` errors: ensure `pkg-config` is installed and that GTK3 / libserialport development packages are present.
- `xxd: command not found`: install `xxd` (often via `vim-common` or `xxd` package).
- Linking failures for GTK or libserialport: check `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0 libserialport` to see what flags are returned.
